I used a basic MVC structure.

It doesn't read files from a database because I was running out of time, but you can edit the CSV files in the "data" folder, 
or you can point to different files in "PrintReports.getReports()."

I'm creating objects from the database or CSV files, in my case.

I added a little button within a Swing window, although I typically stear away from Swing. 

It's not much to look at, but I assumed that wasn't part of the challenge.

I wasn't sure if I was supposed to display multiple data for a single month or sum it up by month. I went with what I felt was safer and displayed it. 
Typically I would get that kind of information before starting, but couldn't really reach out to you. 

I'm interested in seeing out how it tests out. I tested a bit of my own phoney data, but it would have been nice to run more tests before submitting it.

It was a fun project. Thanks.
